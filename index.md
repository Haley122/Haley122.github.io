### Projects
#### Distributed optical fiber sensing technologies
Distributed optical fiber sensors allow many points to be measured simultaneously, and it is compatible to ubiquitously deployed underground fiber system for telecommunication purpoose.
##### 1. Distributed acoustic sensing (DAS)
The working principle of DAS is based on the phase-sensitive OTDR that utilizes the interference effect of Rayleigh backscattering of different scatters within the pulse width. A DAS prototype that can realize real-time vibration sensing along 30 km optical fiber was built in our lab.

- we published a 10 class dataset named DAS1K, check our [project page](https://github.com/Haley122/Distributed-Acoustic-Sensor-DAS1K-Pattern-Recognition)
- we proposed an interference fading method based on space division multiplexing, check our [paper](https://opg.optica.org/oe/fulltext.cfm?uri=oe-29-10-15452&id=450754)
- we proposed a multipath DAS system based on frequency division multiplexing technology, check our [paper](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0143816621000634)

##### 2. Distributed temperature and strain sensing (DTSS)
The working principle of DTSS is based on the stimulated Brillouin scattering that utilizes the linear relationship of Brillouin frequency shift and temperature/strain. A DTSS system that can realize temperature/strain sensing along 50 km optical fiber was built in our lab.

#### Application of Distributed optical fiber sensing technologies
##### DAS for water pipe leak detection
Key facts: 
- Over **2.3 billion** people currently live in water-stressed countries
- **20-30%** of the water is lost in most countries due to leakage
- Hong Kong loses about **15%** of water in mains, over 155 million ùëö<sup>3</sup> annually
- Hong long launched Replacement and Rehabilitation Programme of Water Mains (R&R programme) to replace 3,000 kilometres of aged water mains with HK$23.6 billion budget from 2000

Our work: Distributed vibration measurements along a 40-meter-long recirculating water pipe by leveraging the sensing capability of a standard outdoor fiber-optic cable are presented to prove the concept. A leak identification algorithm based on 3D convolutional neural networks (3D-CNNs) that jointly utilize temporal, spectral, and spatial information is proposed. It can detect leak flow rate as low as 0.027 L/s with a location accuracy of within 3 meters and quantification accuracy of over 85%.
